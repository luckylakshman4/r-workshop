# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

```{r}
# library(tidyverse)
# library(readxl)
# library(here)

# use read_csv() to read in the file
# use here() within read_csv() to tell it where to look
# assign the stored data an object name (weâ€™ll store ours as ca_np)

```

ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv")) #to read csv file

View(ca_np) to view data in separator viewing tab
explore our data frame a bit more to see what it contains

```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
names(ca_np) # to see the variable (column) names
head(ca_np) # to see the first x rows (6 is the default)
summary(ca_np) # see a quick summary of each variable
```
